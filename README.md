# Hi, I'm Lotta! 👋

**From Healthcare to IT** | Final-Year IT Student | Healthcare IT Enthusiast | **Available for summer 2026 internships** | Open to collaboration on projects

Welcome to my GitHub profie!

I'm now in my final year studying Business IT at JAMK. My studies have focused on backend development, databases, and cloud infrastructure. I'm highly motivated to find my place in this new career path where I can combine my previous work experience with modern technologies.

Technology is developing at a dizzying pace, so humane skills such as creativity, empathy and critical thinking will be increasingly emphasized. Nursing taught me to stay calm in chaotic situations, prioritize effectively, and collaborate in multidisciplinary teams.
